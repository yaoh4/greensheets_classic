This file is to help me remember regular expressions that should be used in preparing question 
definition XML files for Greensheets. Specifically, when the initial file is generated by a 
VBA Program that I wrote that is inside the Excel spreadsheet, it needs to be "split" into two 
copies, for Competing and Non-Competing question pools - and then removing from each of those 
"cloned" files the references to TypeMechs, and the questions, that belong only in the other 
file, can be accomplished using TextPad text editor and the regular expressions below.

		- Anatoli Kouznetsov.


To find all lines with the element <TypeMech> whose "type" attribute has the value of 5:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.*type="5".*

This can be used with Replace dialog; replace the found line with "nothing" (null).


To delete all totally blank lines:
----------------------------------
\n\n

(use with Replace and replace with "nothing" (null).


To find a question that has its <GrantTypeMechs> element empty (and therefore, should be deleted from 
the file altogether):
---------------------
<GrantTypeMechs>\n.*</GrantTypeMechs>

Once the question is found using the above method, you should select the whole question manually and 
delete it.
