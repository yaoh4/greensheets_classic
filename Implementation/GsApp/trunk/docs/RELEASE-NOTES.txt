BUG FIXES
============
#284   Edited the Code to filter out Frozen Greensheets for users of type Specialist when they Login to the Default Screen.  

#287   Fixed the Issue where the problem is:- If a user enters as a part of the comment on a greensheet form any special characters that would require "escaping" them in order to make them a 
	part of a character string to be used in a SQL INSERT statement (such as single quote/apostrophy, and many others), then, before insertion into the database, such
	characters effectively become TWO characters because they have the escape character precede them. If the length of the comment the user entered is very close to the 
	length limit of the database column, then the added "extra" escape characters can make the string longer than the database will allow. Attempting to insert the row 
	then results in an SQL exception and an error.
