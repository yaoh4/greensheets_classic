	<!-- WARNING: The Database connection paramters should correctly be specified in the db.properties file. -->

	<!--
	The location on the disk where the Greensheets attachments are stored is specified using the disk-location element.
	db-prefix specifies the prefix that is attached to the FILE_LOCATION for each of the attachment recorded in the Database.
	Usually, both the elements db-prefix and disk-location would have the same value.
	However, disk-location may be different than the  db-prefix in order to test the application 
	on the local PC under Windows environment.
	report-loc specifies the location on the disk where the report generated by the application would be stored.

	The DB User IDs/Passwords and the connection strings are specified in a separate properties file (called db.properties), 
	because the Greensheets Documents Checker application uses another utility class developed by Oracle team 
	that cannot support the .XML files.
